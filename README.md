DotProtect
========
DotProtect is based on ConfuserEx which is an open-source protector for .NET applications.
And ConfuserEx is the successor of [Counfuser](http://confuser.codeplex.com) project.

Features
--------
* Supports .NET Framework 2.0/3.0/3.5/4.0/4.5
* Symbol renaming (Support WPF/BAML)
* Protection against debuggers/profilers
* Protection against memory dumping
* Protection against tampering (method encryption)
* Control flow obfuscation
* Constant/resources encryption
* Reference hiding proxies
* Disable decompilers
* Embedding dependency
* Compressing output
* Extensible plugin API

So what's the point of this?
-------
Well the main reason for this repo is to bundle everything together for easier deployment and to be used as a portable library rather than a stand alone application.
Otherwise I know very little of how it actually works as I haven't had much time to properly look into it.
